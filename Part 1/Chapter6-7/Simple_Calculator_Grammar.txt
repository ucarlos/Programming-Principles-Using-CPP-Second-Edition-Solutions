Print:

Statement:
	Declaration
	Expression
	Userfunction


Expression:
	Term
	Expression + Term
	Expression - Term

Term:
	Primary
	Term * Primary
	Term / Primary
	Term % Primary

Primary:
	Number
	(Expression)
	- Primary
	+ Primary
Number:
	Floating-point-literal


Declaration:
	"let" Name "=" Expression
	"let" Name "=" Userfunction


Userfunction: // 
	 Userfunction(Expression>)
	 
	 Userfunction(Expression, Expression) // IGNORE THIS FOR NOW



The best idea is to first calculate the expression, and then do the function_call.


So the inside could be
	function_name(<expression>)
